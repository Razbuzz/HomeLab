This repository contains the infrastructure-as-code (Docker Compose) for a robust, automated home media server and lab environment. The stack is designed to run on a Linux environment (Ubuntu recommended) and features a fully automated media acquisition pipeline, hardware-accelerated streaming, and network storage management.
